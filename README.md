## What is Kestra?

Kestra is an open-source, event-driven orchestration platform that makes both scheduled and event-driven workflows easy. By bringing Infrastructure as Code best practices to data, process, and microservice orchestration, you can build reliable workflows directly from the UI in just a few lines of YAML.
